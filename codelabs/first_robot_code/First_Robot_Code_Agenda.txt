Today's Agenda

First Robot Code codelab
	- Download the codelab from GitHub
	- Read over Robot.java to learn what it does
	- Deploy code to the test board
		Use the "(First Robot Code) Deploy" run config
	- Fire up the Driver Station and try it out!

Tour of the Test Board
	- aka: crash course in FRC electronics
	- Why do we need a motor controller?
	- Why does the gearbox encoder do for us?

Your turn for programming
	- Update the codelab so the motor 
	  only runs when the trigger is pressed
	- Convert from Joystick to XBoxController
