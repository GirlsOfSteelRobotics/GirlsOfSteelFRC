    // Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.

    // Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
    // the button is released.
    // button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());

    // Start the command when the button is released  and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
